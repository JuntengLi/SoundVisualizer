Hey there! thanks for trying out my sound visualizer!

In order to run this, you're going to need Processing version 2.0b8

You can download that here: http://processing.org/download/

Controls:
Mouse: move it around to push the balls
Left Click: Draw nearby balls to the cursor

P: Pause
Space: Toggle rainbow on the moving ball
N: Next song
B: Previous song


If something goes wrong and it wont close, press the stop button in the Processing window (its a square)

Also, the first song it plays sounds really bad sometimes, so if you go to the next song and then back
it should sound fine after that.
